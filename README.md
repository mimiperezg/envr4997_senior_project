PyrSIG: For downloading and processing satellite data.

Xarray: For handling and analyzing multidimensional data.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas matplotlib pyrsig xarray
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook.

Open the notebook in Google Colab (recommended for handling large datasets).

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code. The data files will be automatically retrieved from the respective satellite portals via PyrSIG.

Acknowledgments
